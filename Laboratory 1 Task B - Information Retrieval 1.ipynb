    "# Task B - Information Retrieval 1\n",
    "1. Consider an academic journal of your own choice and collect 20 abstracts using a method of your own (can be a simple manual copy-and-past operation) in a single file. Save this file in your local desk. Save also the keywords mentioned in each abstract file (if the journal allows for keywords, otherwise you may use words of title of the paper as keywords) in another separate file.\n",
    "2. Consider an information retrieval system where a keyword plays the role search query. Write a script that uses logical query-matching for five queries of your own choice (from the list of keywords) to find out whether a given query is found in the document or not, so that for each keyword input, the program outputs 1 if a logical matching is found (the given keyword is found in the abstract) and 0, otherwise.\n",
    "3. Now instead, of compiling the abstracts into a single file, we want to keep each abstract as a separate file, labeled as A1, A2, …, A20. Write a script that constructs an inverted file of the abstract files. Then suggest a program that employs a simple string matching operation to output the list of files (abstract-file (A0, A1,..A20)) for each keyword.\n",
    "4. We want to relax the assumption of exact matching between keywords and words of the abstract and allow the matching to be considered correct if 90% of the characters of the keywords are found in one word of the abstract. Write a script that implements this reasoning and display the result of your search operation. "
